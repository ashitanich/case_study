                <h2>Discovery & Planning</h2>
                <p>The <strong>Discovery & Planning</strong> phase established the foundation for the project by setting
                    clear goals, defining processes, and conducting a thorough audit of the existing website. This phase
                    ensured alignment between stakeholders and provided actionable insights to guide the redesign.</p>
                <h3>Building a Collaborative Roadmap</h3>
                <p>To navigate a project of this scale, we developed a detailed project roadmap that outlined each step
                    of the UX process, from content strategy to web development milestones. Coordination was streamlined
                    using tools like Wrike for task management, Microsoft Teams for communication, and Outlook for
                    scheduling and tracking deadlines. These tools ensured everyone stayed on the same page, fostering
                    efficiency and transparency.</p>
                <h3>Uncovering Insights Through a Content Audit</h3>
                <p>We conducted a comprehensive audit of the existing website to identify areas for improvement. This
                    involved evaluating redundant or outdated content, analyzing SEO elements like meta descriptions,
                    H1s, and URL structures, and reviewing digital assets such as images, videos, forms, and PDFs. The
                    audit revealed several critical insights:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Internal Search Overload: </strong>Poor navigation forced users to rely heavily on
                        search to locate key information.</li>
                    <li><strong>Engagement Trends:</strong> Audience-specific pages like "Freshman How to Apply"
                        performed significantly better, highlighting the importance of segmented content.</li>
                    <li><strong>Low-Performing Pages:</strong> Pages with minimal traffic were flagged for consolidation
                        or removal to streamline the information architecture.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Data-Driven Performance Analysis</h3>
                <p>Using Google Analytics, Looker Studio dashboards, and SEMrush, we analyzed performance metrics such
                    as click-through rates, traffic, and user engagement. This data informed decisions on which content
                    to prioritize, update, or remove, ensuring that the redesigned website would address user needs
                    effectively.</p>
                <h3>Tools That Empowered the Process</h3>
                <p>The success of this phase relied on a carefully curated set of tools:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Content & Performance Analysis</strong>: Google Analytics, Looker Studio, SEMrush.</li>
                    <li><strong>Planning & Mapping:</strong> Gloomaps and Slickplan to reimagine navigation and site
                        structure.</li>
                    <li><strong>Coordination & Collaboration:</strong> Wrike, Teams, Outlook, and Lucidspark for
                        seamless communication and task management.</li>

                <h2>Research & Ideation</h2>
                <p>The Research & Ideation phase was dedicated to uncovering user needs, testing assumptions, and
                    validating the new Information Architecture (IA). Through qualitative research, usability testing,
                    and collaboration with subject matter experts (SMEs), this phase provided critical insights that
                    informed every aspect of the redesign.</p>

                <h3>Understanding User Behavior Through Research</h3>
                <p>To build an IA that truly reflected user needs, we delved into trends across undergraduate, graduate,
                    and international admissions. Post-pandemic, a notable shift emerged: undergraduate students
                    prioritized financial stability over passion-driven career paths. This insight significantly
                    influenced the organization of financial aid and admissions content, ensuring these concerns were
                    addressed upfront in the new IA.</p>

                <h3>Revealing Pain Points with Usability Testing</h3>
                <p>Usability testing sessions with high school juniors exposed key challenges in the existing site.
                    Participants were asked to complete tasks like locating scholarship information without relying on
                    search—a method intended to surface navigation issues. The results were eye-opening: only 23% of
                    tasks were successfully completed, highlighting severe wayfinding issues and a misalignment between
                    the IA and user behavior. This feedback underscored the need for a major overhaul of the navigation
                    system.</p>

                <h3>Validating Navigation Through Card Sorting</h3>
                <p>To refine the IA, we facilitated card sorting sessions with users and admissions SMEs. These
                    exercises validated the proposed navigation structure and uncovered gaps that needed attention.
                    Collaborating with SMEs allowed us to incorporate critical insights about student behavior,
                    regulatory requirements, and admissions workflows into the IA. This partnership ensured the new
                    structure aligned with both user expectations and institutional goals.</p>

                <h3>Building a Streamlined Sitemap</h3>
                <p>The iterative process of creating the sitemap was a cornerstone of this phase. Tools like Gloomaps
                    and Slickplan helped us design a navigation system that prioritized user-centric content
                    discoverability. The sitemap integrated clear calls-to-action, outlined page goals, and reflected
                    the insights gained from testing and SME feedback. Each iteration was shaped by collaborative
                    discussions with the admissions team, marketing strategists, web content experts, and recruiters,
                    ensuring the final structure was both comprehensive and practical.</p>

                <h2>Design Implementation</h2>
                <p>Designing a mobile-first admissions website for a diverse audience required balancing creativity,
                    functionality, and user-centered strategies. Every decision—from wireframing to multimedia
                    integration—was driven by the goal of simplifying navigation, amplifying engagement, and fostering
                    inclusivity.
                </p>
                <h3>Wireframing with a Mobile-First Focus</h3>
                <p>We began by wireframing 28+ key pages, using a mobile-first approach to ensure that every layout
                    worked seamlessly on smaller screens before scaling to larger devices. The challenge was translating
                    complex content into clear, digestible sections that would resonate with prospective students
                    navigating the site on the go. These wireframes became the foundation for the broader design
                    standards applied across all 58 pages, ensuring every element—from typography to spacing—aligned
                    with the university’s brand and maintained visual consistency.
                </p>
                <h3>Dynamic Content with Flex Areas</h3>
                <p>Recognizing the need for dynamic and personalized content, we introduced <strong>Flex Areas</strong>
                    on key pages. These zones allow admissions staff to update content quickly, ensuring messaging stays
                    relevant to ongoing campaigns or user funnel stages. For example, prospective students exploring
                    scholarship opportunities might see tailored calls-to-action guiding them to financial aid
                    resources, all optimized for mobile navigation.</p>
                <h3>Visual Storytelling that Connects</h3>
                <p>Visual storytelling was another critical focus. We curated over 140 multimedia assets, including
                    embedded virtual tours, campus imagery, and videos like <i>Is CMU Walkable?</i>. These assets were
                    selected not only for their quality but also for their ability to help students imagine themselves
                    on campus. Hero images and video content emphasized diversity, inclusivity, and vibrant campus life,
                    creating an emotional connection with users from diverse backgrounds. Importantly, all visuals were
                    optimized for mobile-first performance, ensuring fast load times without compromising quality.</p>
                <h3>Strategic Navigation and Conversion Optimization</h3>
                <p>Our design choices weren’t just about aesthetics—they were strategic. By cross-linking pages
                    contextually, we guided users through a cohesive journey, making it easier for them to find the
                    information they needed. Top-level pages were designed with <strong>conversion rate
                        optimization</strong> in mind, placing critical links and navigation elements exactly where
                    users expected them.

                    <h3>Outcomes</h3>
                    <p>The result was a mobile-first, visually engaging admissions website that enhanced navigation,
                        improved task success rates, and fostered stronger connections with prospective students.
                        Dynamic content areas and strategically placed calls-to-action contributed to higher engagement,

                <h2>Development & Testing</h2>
                <p>Bringing the admissions website to life required careful attention to scalability, accessibility, and
                    user experience. On the development site, we built custom templates tailored to the unique needs of
                    the admissions team. These templates accommodated different page structures, such as those with or
                    without left-hand navigation, ensuring flexibility for future updates while maintaining a consistent
                    design language. The modular system allowed for seamless scalability, enabling the website to grow
                    with the university’s evolving needs.</p>
                <h3>Resolving User Pain Points with Targeted Enhancements</h3>
                <p>We developed and implemented 22 targeted tasks to resolve these issues, from refining padding for
                    better readability to improving responsiveness for mobile users. Each improvement directly
                    contributed to creating a polished and user-friendly experience.</p>
                <h3>Thorough Testing</h3>
                <p>We conducted extensive sitewide testing to ensure functionality and a seamless user journey:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Verified links, buttons, and navigation components to prevent dead ends.</li>
                    <li>Tested redirects to ensure users reached updated pages smoothly.</li>
                    <li>Led quality assurance testing to ensure WCAG compliance for all microsites.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>This thorough testing ensured the website delivered a consistent experience across all devices and
                    browsers, meeting the diverse technological needs of its users. By prioritizing accessibility and
                    inclusivity, the platform was designed to serve students of all abilities, aligning with the mission
                    to provide equitable access to critical admissions information.</p>
